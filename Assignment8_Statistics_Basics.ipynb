    "The arithmetic average of a dataset, calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the total number of observations.\n",

Standard deviation, the square root of variance, offers a more interpretable measure of spread by using the same units as the data.

The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), with lines (whiskers) extending to the smallest and largest values within 1.5 times the IQR. Outliers are displayed as individual points outside this range. Box plots help identify skewness, variability, and symmetry in datasets."

For example, randomly selecting 500 voters from a city to predict election outcomes provides a fair representation compared to selecting only those from a specific neighborhood."

Positive skewness occurs when the right tail is longer, indicating many lower values with a few large ones (e.g., salaries in an organization). Negative skewness, with a longer left tail, indicates the opposite (e.g., age at retirement). Skewed data affects central tendency measures; for example, the mean shifts toward the tail, making the median a more reliable central measure."

It helps detect outliers, which are values below Q1 - 1.5×IQR or above Q3 + 1.5×IQR. For example, in a dataset of exam scores, scores significantly lower or higher than the bulk of results can be identified as outliers."

The empirical rule states that about 68% of data lies within 1 standard deviation from the mean, 95% within 2, and 99.7% within 3.
